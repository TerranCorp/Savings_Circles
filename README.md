Welcome to my Github.

This repository focuses on a Full-Stack Web application with React as the front end, asp.net 2.2 (C#) as middle-ware, and a T-SQL relational database as the db.

The following code is from a small portion of the website application that focuses on a user's location.

A simplified list of tools and technologies that were used to build this application are found below

***********************************************

Front-end: JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, Axios, AJAX, Bootstrap 4, Google Maps

Middleware: ASP.NET, C#, ADO.NET, .NET Core 2.2

Backend: SQL

Tools: Visual Studio 2019, Visual Code 2019, SQL Management Studio 2019, Postman

***********************************************
In this repository you will find:

-Previews of code in C# and React JSX (JavaScript)

-Stored Procedures for SQL relational database

-Screenshots of what the web application looks like

-Api Controllers with their respective services


If you have any questions, please ask!

(This code is not functional in it's solitary form, nor is it meant to be. It is purely a demonstration of my coding abilities and styles.)
